# **DonorFlow: Predicting Donation Patterns**  

### **Overview**  
DonorFlow is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict donation behaviors based on past contributions. By combining **clustering** and **classification techniques**, this model helps organizations understand donor patterns and personalize outreach for future donations.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Cluster Donors Based on Behavior** – Groups donors by frequency, donation size, and total contributions.  
✅ **Predict Future Donations** – Uses machine learning to identify donors likely to give again.  
✅ **Data-Driven Insights** – Helps organizations tailor fundraising efforts based on donor habits.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Load & Preprocess Data** – Import donation records and extract useful features.  
2. **Cluster Donors** – Group donors based on giving habits using K-Means clustering.  
3. **Train a Prediction Model** – Classify whether a donor is likely to contribute again.  
4. **Visualize Insights** – Generate charts to explore donation trends.  
5. **Deploy & Share** – Save the trained model and upload it for community use.  

### **Setup Instructions**  
#### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DonorFlow.git
cd DonorFlow
```

#### **2. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **3. Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Open `donation_analysis.ipynb` and follow the steps inside.
